# L-systems

This project aims to implement the creation of fractal trees using L-systems

L-systems was first developed by a biologist named Lindenmayor. The systems was used to study the development of simple multicellular organisms, then subsequently apply to create plant organs.

### How does it work?
L-systems involves defining a string of symbols, the meaning for each symbols, and rules, then keep applying this rules for a number of iterations.
